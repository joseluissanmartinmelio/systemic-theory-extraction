We contend that this assumption is misconceived, that the mass-party model is only one, temporally limited and contingent model, and that it is necessary to differentiate notions of adaptation and change from notions of decline or failure. Following an analysis of how various models of party can be located in terms of the relationship between civil society and the state, we contend that the recent period has witnessed the emergence of a new model of party, the cartel party, in which colluding parties become agents of the state and employ the resources of the state (the party state) to ensure their own collective survival. Finally, we suggest that the recent challenge to party is in fact a challenge to the cartel that the established parties have created for themselves. © 1995, Sage Publications.

Recent and dramatic changes in the world, however, raise important questions about the meaning and importance of left-right ideology. Most notably, the collapse of communism has led to the development of a host of new democracies. And in advanced industrial societies, conflict has emerged over issues like the environment and immigration. This paper draws on a survey of political experts in 42 societies to address three questions raised by these changes. First, is the language of left and right still widely used, even in recently democratized countries? Second, do there exist secondary dimensions of political conflict that are orthogonal to the left-right dimension? Third, and most importantly, what substantive issues define the meaning of left-right ideology? In addition to addressing these questions, we present data on the left-right locations of political parties in each of the 42 countries. © 1995, Sage Publications.

The extent to which programmatic structuring takes place in post-communism depends on countries' democratic experience and the nature of their democratic institutions fostering more personalized or more depersonalized power relations. These institutions, in turn, are influenced by the pathways of transition from communism to democracy, the type of communist rule and earlier traditions of democratization and industrialization in the inter-war era. With regard to the content of cleavage divisions, the paper identifies several configurations of party systems. Determinants are derived from voters' economic interests, the varying salience of socio-cultural conflicts in post-communist countries and the relations among ethnic groups. © 1995, Sage Publications.

In old as well as in new democracies, fears run high and the literature is booming. Specters are evasive, however. Political scientists have tried to get hold of this one under labels like protest, populist or extremist parties. Yet the 'anti-political' ideology which is central for many of these outsider parties has not received the systematic attention it deserves. The present piece of discourse analysis pretends to fill this gap. It argues that anti-political-establishment parties construct two specific cleavages. They contrapose the political elite against citizens, on the one hand, and against themselves, on the other. In its main part, the article analyzes the symbolic strategies anti-political-establishment parties employ in constructing this double conflict. It proceeds to describe their dilemmatic position in between normal and anti-democratic opposition, sketches the possible career paths of anti-political-establishment parties, and concludes with some notes on available counter-strategies. © 1996 SAGE Publications.",Extremism; New parties; Political opposition; Populism; Right-wing politics,,,,,,,,"Anderson B., Imagined Communities, 2nd Edn., (1991); Archer R.P., Electoral Rules, Party Strength, and Governability in Latin America, XVIIth International Congress of the Latin American Studies Association, (1992); Arendt H., On Revolution, (1963); Backes U., Nationalpopulismus und Rechtsextremismus im westlichen Deutschland: Kritische Betrachtungen zum neuerlichen ""Hoch"" in Politik und Literatur, Neue Politische Literatur, 35, pp. 443-471, (1990); Bailer-Galanda B., Die Neue Rechte.

The analysis of the relationship between civil society and the state, which constitutes a central element in Katz and Mair's concept of the cartel party, is considered to be too static to grasp the increased intervention by the state in society. The application of a term derived from the level of the party system ('cartel') to individual parties does not seem to be a happy choice, while the reality of western party systems does not show an effective cartel of parties. It is argued that, instead of trying to formulate (again) an alleged dominant party type for the present time, it seems more fruitful to develop a classification scheme of parties that allows for different types of parties to co-exist at the same time, without considering one of them as the most up to date.

It is suggested that the crisis concerns more a type of party rather than the party per se. Second, the challenges to the party are analysed. In the last decade a convergent attack against the traditional parties has been carried on: on one side, by the new social movements and their partisan representatives, the left-libertarian or New Politics parties; on the other side, by the newly emerged extreme right parties. This paper tries to demonstrate that both types of party are the by-products of the same structural conditions and both provide a (different) answer to the crisis of the party's expressive function.

Achterburgwal 237, Netherlands","In this article it is argued that the conceptualization of anti-immigrant parties has been inadequate. Starting from the non-theoretical concept of anti-immigrant parties, three main concepts are discussed and defined: protest parties, racist parties and extreme-right parties. Each of these concepts has its own emphasis and highlights a specific feature of a political family in statu nascendi. Protest parties are non-revolutionary anti-system parties; racist parties are single-issue parties, while extreme-right parties are revolutionary anti-system parties. The article develops a typology of anti-immigrant parties that runs from the general and diffuse (protest parties) to the specific (racist) and ideologically articulate (extreme right). The concepts are not nested but are overlapping, yet they allow us to differentiate between different types of anti-immigrant parties in Western Europe. Protest parties are primarily a product of political alienation, racist parties arise from misgivings about national immigration policy, while extreme-right parties implicitly or explicitly present a political tradition that reacts against the spirit of international capitalism. Researchers who concentrate on electorates tend to use the concept of protest party, those who study militants tend towards the concept of racist parties while those who analyse party programmes and ideology often use the label extreme right.

The data provided by analysing the results of the 1994 provincial elections in Western Siberia confirm the prominence of the 'bosses' in the electoral arena of the Russian periphery. Viewing this phenomenon as an important functional equivalent to political parties, the paper explains its salience with reference to its origins in the nomenklatura system, and to the strategic choices made by the Russian leadership in late 1991. It is suggested that the recent attempts to create a regular political organization on the basis of the 'bosses' have failed to facilitate the process of party system formation in Russia. © 1997 SAGE Publications.",'bosses'; Elections; Managerial elite; Russia; Siberia,,,,,,,,"Babkina M.A., New Political Parties and Movements in the Soviet Union, (1991); Beissinger M.R., Transformation and Degeneration: The CPSU under Reform, Cracks in the Monolith: Party Power in the Brezhnev Era, pp. 213-235, (1992); Belin L., The Chernomyrdin Bloc Surges Forward, Transition: Events and Issues in the Former Soviet Union and East-Central and Southeastern Europe, 1, 15, pp. 21-26, (1995); Belin L., Orttung R.W., Parties Proliferate on Eve of Elections, Transition: Events and Issues in the Former Soviet Union and East-Central and Southeastern Europe, 1, 17, pp. 42-50, (1995); Bertschi C.C., Lustration and the Transition to Democracy: The Cases of Poland and Bulgaria, East European Quarterly, 28, pp. 435-451, (1994); Blondel J., The Discipline of Politics, (1981); Breslauer G., Gorbachev: Diverse Perspectives, Soviet Economy, 7, pp. 110-120, (1990); Brudny Y.M., The Dynamics of ""Democratic Russia"", 1990-1993, Post-Soviet Affairs, 9, pp. 141-170, (1993); Cain B.E., Et al., The Constituency Service Basis of the Personal Vote for U.S. Representatives and British Members of Parliament, Controversies in Voting Behavior, 2nd Edn, pp. 292-313, (1984); Curtis G.L., The Japanese Way of Politics, (1988); Dallin A., Alternative Forms of Political Representation and Advocacy, Political Parties in Russia, pp. 80-88, (1993); Ekiert G., Democratic Processes in East Central Europe: A Theoretical Reconsideration, British Journal of Political Science, 21, pp. 285-315, (1991)","G.V.

This paper argues that 'institutionalization' as it is frequently used encompasses a diverse set of meanings that are better thought of as conceptually distinct. The paper examines two phenomena that have been widely associated with institutionalization: 'value infusion' and 'behavioral routinization'. It uses the case of Peronism in Argentina, which is infused with value but poorly routinized, to demonstrate that these phenomena can vary independently. The paper argues that the failure to make these conceptual distinctions may pose serious problems for causal analysis. As an example, it shows how different conceptions of institutionalization lead to opposing arguments about the relation between institutionalization and the capacity of parties to adapt to changing electoral and policy environments. The paper then examines the distinction between formal and informal routinization with respect to political parties, arguing that many studies of political parties fail to incorporate informally routinized behavior patterns into their conceptions of institutionalization.

In each case the new electoral system entails the election of most MPs by single-member plurality, while the remainder are elected from lists. The aims of the reform were less clear, and more party-driven, in Japan than in New Zealand. In Japan there is no evidence as yet that 'money politics', or the importance of the individual candidate, have disappeared. The new systems have had an effect on the internal life of the parties, especially on candidate selection. The change in the New Zealand system, as could have been predicted, has led to a great increase in proportionality, but the new Japanese system is actually less proportional than the previous single non-transferable vote electoral system. The effect on the New Zealand political system will be major, but the extent of the impact of electoral system change in Japan is not yet clear.

Four party-level factors have some explanatory power: organizational structure, ideology, women party activists and gender-related candidate rules. A temporal sequence is proposed in which these factors and electoral rules directly and indirectly affect women's representation. Women party activists and gender-related rules are the more direct mechanisms affecting women's legislative representation.

Either they have been inconsistent with democratic premises, or those premises have been flawed in the first place. This article develops a viable defence for internally democratic parties based on the deliberative theory of democracy. Parties should be internally democratic in order to provide a vertical linkage between different deliberating spheres and a horizontal linkage between competing issues. In addition, intra-party democracy makes policy agenda-setting accountable to the public and provides a second-order principle from which to justify exceptions from internally democratic practices when deemed necessary.

These factors, however, affect different types of new parties differently. 'Prophetic' parties, which articulate a new ideology, are successful if the ideology can be linked to latent or 'subterranean' traditions, provided they can mobilize sufficient resources. 'Purifiers', which refer to an ideology that has been betrayed or diluted by established parties, and prolocutors, which represent interests neglected by established parties, depend mainly on the political opportunity structure and specifically the position of established parties with respect to salient cleavages and issues, as well as on the electoral system.",New parties; Party competition; Party formation,,,,,,,,"Brown C., Chaos and Catastrophe Theories, (1995); Daalder M., De kleine partijen: Een voorlopige poging tot inventarisatie, Acta Politica, 1, pp. 172-196, (1966); Eagles M., Erfle S., Variations in third/minor party support in english constituencies: One-party dominance and community cohesion perspective, European Journal of Political Research, 23, pp. 91-116, (1993); Fireman B., Gamson W.A., Utilitarian Logic in the Resource Mobilization Perspective, pp. 8-44, (1979); Freeman J., Resource Mobilization and Strategy: A Model for Analyzing Social Movement Organization Actions, pp. 167-189, (1979); Fisher S.L., The Minor Parties of the Federal Republic of Germany: Toward a Comparative Theory of Minor Parties, (1974); Hauss C., Rayside D., The development of new parties in Western democracies since 1945, Political Parties: Development and Decay, pp. 31-54, (1978); Hug S., The emergence of the Swiss ecological party: A dynamic model, European Journal of Political Research, 18, pp. 645-670, (1990); Ignazi P., The silent counter-revolution: Hypotheses on the emergence of extreme right-wing parties in Europe, European Journal of Political Research, 22, pp. 3-34, (1992); Jaschke H.-G., Splitterparteien: Indikatoren für unzufriedene minderheiten, Parteien in der Krise?, pp. 221-225, (1987); Kalyvas S., The Rise of Christian Democracy in Europe, (1996); Kitschelt H., Left-libertarian parties: Explaining innovation in competitive systems, World Politics, 15, pp. 194-234, (1988); Kriesi H., The political opportunity structure of new social movements: Its impact on their mobilization, The Politics of Protest.

This article examines the dynamics of coalition formation and breakdown under presidential regimes using evidence from Uruguay (1989-99). Using logistic regression I show that while coalitions are more likely to form immediately after a presidential election, the probability of a political group remaining in an executive coalition decreases as the presidential term elapses. As a result, cycles of cooperation and stalemate among political actors are likely to occur. I also conclude that not only the prospects for political cooperation but also the likelihood of a given fraction leaving a governing coalition are explained by the following variables: ideological affinity between the president's fraction and another political group; presidential approval ratings; affiliation of a fraction with the president's party; proximity of the coming election; and the fairness of the coalition agreement.",Coalition; Electoral cycles; Ideological affinity;

Due to the increased powers of the European Union, parties have an incentive to control their MEPs and to benefit from their expertise on European matters. The findings show that MEPs are still rather independent of their parties. Scrutiny of MEP behaviour is based on consultation rather than on voting instructions.

Among the patterns noted in the data is the contrast between large and small democracies, as well as that between new and older democracies. However, the most striking feature to be noted is the sheer extent and consistency of membership decline through to the end of the 1990s. Not only have levels of party membership continued to decline as a proportion of the electorate, a trend which was already apparent at the end of the 1980s, there is now also compelling evidence of a major decline in the absolute numbers of party members across all the long-established European democracies. As these data clearly reveal, parties in contemporary Europe are rapidly losing their capacity to engage citizens.",Disengagement; Party membership; Party membership decline,,,,,,,,"Bille L., Partier i Forandring: En Analyse af Danske Partiorganisationers Udvikling 1960-1995, (1997); Dachs H., Grünalternative parteien, Handbuch des Politischen Systems Österreichs: Die Zweite Republik, pp. 304-314, (1997); Katz R.S., Mair P., Party Organizations: A Data Handbook, (1992); Katz R.S., Mair P., Et al., The membership of political parties in European democracies, 1960-1990, European Journal of Political Research, 22, pp. 329-345, (1992); Knapp A., France, Political Parties in Advanced Industrial Democracies; Kopecky P., Political Competition and Institutionalization of Parliaments: The Czech and Slovak Republics, (1999); Ladner A., Brandle M., Fact-Sheets zum Wandel der Schweizer Parteien: Ergebnisse aus dem Nationalfonds-Projekt 'die Schweizer Parteiorganisationen im Letzten Drittel des 20.

The first section of this article raises the problems of classifying candidate selection methods and suggests solutions for them. Each of the next four sections offers a dimension for the classification of candidate selection methods: candidacy; party selectorates; decentralization; and voting/appointment systems. The sixth section defines the process of democratizing candidate selection, and demonstrates its implementation in the three largest political parties in Israel prior to the 1996 elections, via the dimensions of the analytical framework. The subsequent section assesses the repercussions of this democratizing phenomenon in general and provides empirical evidence drawn from the Israeli experience in the 1990s.

In contrast to other European party families, traditionally this family has been characterized by the lack of ideological affinity and major differences in two dimensions - demands for political autonomy and traditional ideological orientations - that in the past jeopardized collective action and political cooperation. We argue that the process of Europeanization allowed the very constitution of a European party family from scratch. The article singles out the effects of Europeanization: the creation of a new structure of political opportunities for nationalist parties, changes in party behaviour at the European level, the definition of a new European internationalism and a common political European agenda based on the principle of the lowest common denominator.",Ethnoregionalist; Europeanization; Party family; Peripheral nationalism,,,,,,,,"Bartolini S., Political representation in loosely bounded territories: Between Europe and the national-state, Conference on Multi-level Party Systems: Europeanisation and the Reshaping of National Political Representation, (1999); Bartolini S., Mair P., Identity, Competition and Electoral Availability.

Some new party types have been advanced, but in an ad hoc manner and on the basis of widely varying and often inconsistent criteria. This article is an effort to set many of the commonly used conceptions of parties into a coherent framework, and to delineate new party types whenever the existing models are incapable of capturing important aspects of contemporary parties. We classify each of 15 'species' of party into its proper 'genus' on the basis of three criteria: (1) the nature of the party's organization (thick/thin, elite-based or mass-based, etc.); (2) the programmatic orientation of the party (ideological, particularistic-clientele-oriented, etc.); and (3) tolerant and pluralistic (or democratic) versus proto-hegemonic (or anti-system). While this typology lacks parsimony, we believe that it captures more accurately the diversity of the parties as they exist in the contemporary democratic world, and is more conducive to hypothesis-testing and theory-building than others.",Party organization; Party programmes; Party systems; Party types,,,,,,,,"Adorno T.W., Frenkel-Brunswik E., Levinson D.J., Sanford R.N., The Authoritarian Personality, (1950); Barnes S.H., Party Democracy: Politics in an Italian Socialist Federation, (1967); Beck P.A., Party Politics in America, 8th Edn., (1997); Betz H.-G., Immerfall S., The New Politics of the Right: Neo-populist Parties and Movements in Established Democracies, (1998); Von Beyme K., Political Parties in Western Democracies, (1985); Bosco A., Four actors in search of a role: The Southern European communist parties, Parties, Politics and Democracy in the New Southern Europe, (2001); Burton M., Gunther R., Higley J., Introduction: Elite transformations and democratic regimes, Elites and Democratic Consolidation in Latin America and Southern Europe, (1992); Carr R., Spain: 1808-1939, (1966); Chambers W.N., Burnham W.D., The American Party Systems: States of Political Development, (1967); Daalder H., The rise of parties in Western democracies, Political Parties and Democracy, (2001); Dalton R.J., Wattenberg M.P., Parties Without Partisans: Political Change in Advanced Industrial Democracies, (2000); Diamond L., Gunther R., Political Parties and Democracy, (2001); Duverger M., Political Parties, (1954); Eldersveld S., Political Parties: A Behavioral Analysis, (1964); Epstein L.D., Political Parties in Western Democracies, (1967); Erie S.P., Rainbow's End: Irish-Americans and the Dilemmas of Urban Machine Politics, 1840-1985, (1988); Farrell D.M., Kolodny R., Medvic S.K., Political parties and campaign professionals in a digital age: Political consultants in the U.S. and their counterparts overseas, XVIIth World Congress of Political Science, (2000); Farrell D.M., Webb P., Political parties as campaign organizations, Parties Without Partisans: Political Change in Advanced Industrial Democracies, (2000); Fogarty M.P., Christian Democracy in Western Europe, 1820-1953, (1957); Gosnell H.F., Machine Politics: Chicago Style, (1939); Gunther R., Montero J.R., Linz J.J., Political Parties: Old Concepts and New Challenges, (2002); Gunther R., Mughan A., Democracy and the Media: A Comparative Perspective, (2000); Gunther R., Sani G., Shabad G., Spain After Franco: The Making of a Competitive Party System, (1986); Hagopian F., Traditional Politics and Regime Change in Brazil, (1996); Horowitz D.L., Ethnic Groups in Conflict, (1985); Huntington S.P., Nelson J.M., No Easy Choice: Political Participation in Developing Countries, (1976); Ignazi P., The crisis of parties and the rise of new political parties, Party Politics, 2, pp. 549-566, (1996); Jaung H., Electoral politics and political parties, Institutional Reform and Democratic Consolidation in Korea, (2000); Kalyvas S., The Rise of Christian Democracy in Europe, (1996); Katz R.S., Mair P., Party Organization: A Data Handbook, (1992); Katz R.S., Mair P., How Parties Organize: Change and Adaptation in Party Organization in Western Democracies, (1994); Katz R.S., Mair P., Changing models of party organization and party democracy, Party Politics, 1, pp. 5-28, (1995); Katz R.S., Mair P., The ascendancy of the party in public office: Party organizational change in twentieth-century democracies, Political Parties: Old Concepts and New Challenges, (2002); Key V.O., Southern Politics, (1949); Kim B.-K., Party politics in South Korea's democracy: The crisis of success, Consolidating Democracy in South Korea, (2000); King A., Political parties in western democracies: Some sceptical reflections, Polity, 2, pp. 111-141, (1969); Kirchheimer O., The transformation of the Western European party systems, Political Parties and Political Development, (1966); Kitschelt H., The Logics of Party Formation, (1989); Kitschelt H., The Transformation of European Social Democracy, (1994); Kitschelt H., Divergent paths of postcommunist democracies, Political Parties and Democracy, (2001); Koole R., The vulnerability of the modern cadre party in the Netherlands, How Parties Organize: Change and Adaptation in Party Organization in Western Democracies, (1994); Koole R., Cadre, catch-all or cartel?

The debate about the function of the Internet for pluralism and participation is laid out in Part I. The supply-and-demand research design, including content analysis of 134 websites (supply) and surveys of the public using party websites (demand), in the 15 European Union member states, drawn from the Spring 2000 Eurobarometer, is outlined in Part II. The evidence for patterns of party competition in European party websites is examined in Part III and in Part IV the use of party websites among West Europeans is analyzed.

The level of party nationalization has a prominent effect on such important factors as the survival of democracy, the types of issues that dominate political competition, legislative behaviour and public policy. In spite of its importance, party nationalization has been neglected in the comparative politics literature. Our article makes two contributions. First, it provides a measure of party and party system nationalization, based on the Gini coefficient, that is superior for comparative analysis to those employed to date. Second, it utilizes these measures to analyse nationalization in 17 democracies in the Americas, the first time nationalization has been examined empirically outside the advanced industrial democracies. The measure underscores the widely varying degrees in nationalization across party systems, within party systems over time, across parties within countries and within parties over time.",Latin America; Nationalization; Political parties,,,,,,,,"Ames B., The Deadlock of Democracy in Brazil, (2001); Bawn K., Cox G.W., Rosenbluth F., Measuring the ties that bind: Electoral cohesiveness in four democracies, Elections in Japan under the Single Non-transferable Vote, (1999); Brady D.W., A reevaluation of realignments in american politics: Evidence from the house of representatives, American Political Science Review, 79, pp. 28-49, (1985); Caramani D., Elections in Western Europe Since 1815: Electoral Results by Constituencies, (2000); Chhibber P., Kollman K.W., Party aggregation and the number of parties in India and the United States, American Political Science Review, 92, pp. 329-342, (1998); Claggett W., Planigan W., Zingale N., Nationalization of the American electorate, American Political Science Review, 78, pp. 77-91, (1984); Cox G.W., Making Votes Count: Strategic Coordination in the World's Electoral Systems, (1997); Creedy J., The Dynamics of Inequality and Poverty: Comparing Income Distributions, (1998); Diamond L., Class, Ethnicity, and Democracy in Nigeria: The Failure of the First Republic, (1988); Gibson E.L., Calvo E., Federalism and low-maintenance constituencies: Territorial dimensions of economic reform in Argentina, Studies in Comparative International Development, 35, pp. 32-55, (2000); Harmel R., Svasand L., Party leadership and party institutionalisation: Three phases of development, West European Politics, 16, pp. 67-88, (1993); Huntington S.P., The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century, (1991); Janda K., Political Parties: A Cross-national Survey, (1980); Jenkins S.P.; Kawato S., Nationalization and partisan realignment in congressional elections, American Political Science Review, 81, pp. 1235-1250, (1987); Knutsen O., The strength of the partisan component of left-right identity: A comparative longitudinal study of left-right party polarization in eight West European countries, Party Politics, 4, pp. 5-31, (1998); Lijphart A., Electoral Systems and Party Systems: A Study of Twenty-seven Democracies, 1945-1990, (1994); Lijphart A., Democracy in Plural Societies: A Comparative Exploration, (1977); Mainwaring S.P., Rethinking Party Systems in the Third Wave of Democratization: The Case of Brazil, (1999); Mainwaring S., Scully T.R., Introduction: Party systems in latin America, Building Democratic Institutions: Party Systems in Latin America, (1995); Mayhew D.R., Placing Parties in American Politics: Organization, Electoral Settings, and Government Activity in the Twentieth Century, (1986); Reynolds A., Electoral Systems and Democratization in Southern Africa, (1999); Rose R., Urwin D.W., Regional differentiation and political unity in western nations, Sage Series Number 06-007, 6-7, (1975); Samuels D.J., Careerism and its Consequences: Federalism, Elections, and Policy Making in Brazil; Sani G., Sartori G., Polarization, fragmentation, and competition in western democracies, Western European Party Systems, (1983); Sartori G., Parties and Party Systems: A Framework for Analysis, (1976); Schattschneider E.E., The Semi-sovereign People: A Realist's View of Democracy in America, (1960); Shryock H.S., Siegel J.S., Et al., The Methods and Materials of Demography, (1976); Stepan A.C., Toward a new comparative politics of federalism, (multi)nationalism, and democracy: Beyond rikerian federalism, Arguing Comparative Politics, (2001); Stokes D.E., A variance components model of political effects, Mathematical Applications in Political Science, (1965); Stokes D.E., Parties and the nationalization of electoral forces, The American Party Systems: Stages of Political Development, (1967); Sundquist J.L., Dynamics of the Party System: Alignment and Realignment of Political Parties in the United States, (1973); Taagepera R., Shugart M.S., Seats and Votes: The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems, (1989)","M.P.

The contention of this article is that the increasingly prominent role of the state in the funding of parties should be understood in the context of, and has been legitimized by, an ideational transformation by which parties have gradually come to be seen as necessary and desirable institutions for democracy. Moreover, the direct involvement of the state in internal party affairs has contributed to a transformation of parties from the traditionally voluntary private associations towards parties as public utilities. A comparison of the practice of public funding and public control on party finance in the older liberal democracies with more recent cases of democratization shows that the newer European democracies in particular provide unequivocal testimony of such a new conception of parties and democracy.",Democratic theory;

By means of statistical analyses and a larger dataset than in earlier studies, possible associations are studied. In order to carry out the study, an index of the degree of centralization is constructed. Of the party characteristics, only party size affects the dependent variable: large parties tend to apply more centralized selection methods than small parties. None of the institutional variables determines the degree of centralization of candidate selection. For instance, earlier assertions about the importance of the electoral system and territorial organization are falsified. However, some distinct regional patterns emerge: Southern European parties apply centralized selection methods, whereas candidate selection in Nordic countries is decentralized.",Candidate selection; Centralization; Decentralization; Selection methods,,,,,,,,"Anckar G., Storlek Och Partisystem: En Studie av 77 Stater, (1998); Anckar D., Between Majority and Consensus: the 1999 Democracies, (2002); Bille L., Democratizing a Democratic Procedure: Myth or Reality?, Party Politics, 7, pp. 363-380, (2001); CIA World Factbook, (2002); Chronicle of Parliamentary Elections.

We analyze the evolution and success of these parties, using survey data to track their changing electorates. We find that the FPÖ and SVP have evolved into the typical profile of 'new radical-right' parties in terms of their appeal and supporters. However, they have also been able to appeal to a broader electorate, which in part explains their success.

We present systematic data describing these features and provide a theoretically grounded explanation of them. The explanation emphasizes the role of strategic choice structured by the institutional legacies of authoritarian regimes in the formation and development of political parties. Political restrictions under authoritarian regimes produced severe information deficit concerning electoral mobilization, strategic coordination and the collective action problems that typically attend party formation and coalition-building. Under these constraints, political actors in Africa's emerging democracies established political parties to preserve their fragmented power bases and relied on presidential elections and ethno-political cleavages as alternative sources of strategic coordination over votes and seats and electoral coalition-building. The result is the entry of large numbers of short-lived political parties, producing high volatility, and the electoral and legislative dominance of a small number of large parties producing low party system fragmentation.

Similarly, party system institutionalization is viewed as a requisite for the consolidation of democracy. In contrast, the effects of different party system characteristics on democracy are sharply contested. We contribute to this debate through a systematic analysis of the relationship between three party system characteristics (legislative volatility, the average age of parties, and the effective number of parliamentary parties) and the level of democracy in 33 African countries. Our results show that party system stability, measured by the average age of parties, and party system competitiveness, measured by the effective number of parties, have positive associations with democracy in African countries. Our results highlight the tension and potential trade-offs between stability and competition in the largely inchoate party systems of Africa.

The model is tested using pooled time-series cross-sectional data from 22 OECD countries for elections held between 1960 and 2002. The results show that new parties are more frequent when the institutional structures are permissive (the cost of entry is low), the corporatist arrangements are weak or non-existent (the benefit of entry is high) and the electoral histories of the incumbents are short (the probability of attracting votes is high).

These changes are assumed to be embraced by those who demand greater citizen involvement, though the underlining motivation remains unclear. One theory assumes that support is likely to come from citizens who have a deep interest in politics and are politically active. Another theory offers a contrasting view, claiming that those who find themselves on the periphery of politics, and are largely disenchanted, find such proposals attractive. We examine these theories drawing on public opinion surveys from six established democracies. We find that younger citizens and those who are more interested in the political process are more supportive of direct democracy, while political disaffection has a less consistent impact.

This allows analysis of the policy space in established democracies under the assumption that left and right have different meanings from country to country and over time. The model is illustrated with regard to four Western European countries with different types of party system: Germany, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Empirical findings affirm that the procedures are workable and that the data generated are capable of yielding detailed information beyond that which previous approaches are able to deliver. In addition, preliminary tests on external validity produce reassuring results.

It is the first broadly cross-regional analysis of electoral volatility, and it is based on the most extensive data assembled on electoral volatility. Our most original finding is that competitive regimes inaugurated in earlier periods have much lower electoral volatility than regimes inaugurated more recently, even controlling for a variety of other factors that have been hypothesized to affect electoral volatility. Parties had very different functions according to when democracy was inaugurated, and these congenital differences had longterm effects on the stabilization of party competition. What matters for the stabilization of party competition is when democracy was born, not how old it is. Our results support social science approaches that emphasize historical sequences and path dependence.

Where the radical right first campaigned on a neo-liberal and authoritarian programme, it now presents a more centrist economic position. The article tests this idea through a reconstruction of the positions of the French Front National, the Flemish Vlaams Blok and the Dutch Lijst Pim Fortuyn, and establishes that some, but not all, radical right parties make use of the new winning formula. Moreover, innovative analysis of the positions of radical right parties in West European party systems reveals that Kitschelt's theory needs to be improved on several points, most notably when it comes to the definition of concepts and the operationalization of dimensions.

This article argues that such party ties are also a measure of party system institutionalization from the standpoint of the public. We apply Converse's model of partisan learning to 36 nations surveyed as part of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems. We find that electoral experience and parental socialization are strong sources of partisanship, but the third-wave democracies also display evidence of latent socialization carried over from the old regime. The results suggest that party identities can develop in new democracies if the party system creates the conditions to develop these bonds.

We address the relationship between internal party democracy, as indicated by the inclusiveness of parties' selectorates, and the realization of two associated democratic values - the extent of both competition in the nomination process and representation among the lists of candidates that emerge. Although we analyse these relationships within party, our interest in them is primarily for their system level impact. We find that the three democratic values of inclusive participation, competition and representativeness are unlikely to be simultaneously maximized. Rather, the relationships among these values may be non-linear, or even negative. In particular, the parties that are most internally democratic produce lists of candidates that are least representative and experience only medium levels of competition.

But this interest is also proving uneven, with relatively little attention now being given to the study of party systems. More specifically, the level of theoretical interest in party systems remains limited, with almost no substantial innovations being made since the publication of Sartori's classic work of 1976. In this article, we seek to redress some of this neglect by identifying the relevant parameters that can be used in the definition of party systems and, possibly, in the explanation of party system change. We then go on to look at the minimum defining characteristics of a system of parties (as opposed to a set of parties) before finally arguing that party systems are best understood as multidimensional phenomena in which we identify and discuss the implications of three types of division - vertical, horizontal and functional.

What factors account for the extensive array of electoral reforms adopted in the region since the return to democracy? How are shifting patterns of political representation related to institutional change? In addressing these questions, I develop an account of electoral reform that places shifting partisan political fortunes at the center of analysis and show that changes in the rules of the electoral game tend to reflect the political self-interest of dominant political parties as defined in relation to mounting electoral uncertainty. The evidence regarding the impact of electoral reforms on party system change is less consistent with the expectations derived from the comparative institutional literature. Over the past two decades, party system change in Latin America has generated institutional change more predictably than vice versa.

In order to make sense of these manifestations of public discontent, I argue that one must examine the nature of political appeals, political actors' locations vis-à-vis the party system and the linkages between citizens and government. Doing so, furthermore, helps clarify the meaning of populism, one of the most elusive concepts in political science. The definition of populism I offer allows us to synthesize much of the literature on the subject while weeding out unnecessary and secondary characteristics. Importantly, too, this definition allows us to separate competing claims of 'direct democracy' and thus populists from non-populists.

We argue that the growing uncertainties about the future of European integration among national publics are increasingly politicized by Eurosceptical elites on both the extreme right and left of the political spectrum. To analyse the cueing effects of these extremist parties, we employ a two-level hierarchical linear model which combines individual-level and contextual data. We show that Eurosceptic cues are, indeed, found on both extremes, but for different reasons. Whereas right-wing extremist parties oppose European integration with the defence of 'national sovereignty' and successfully mobilize national identity considerations against the EU, left-wing extremist parties resist further integration in Europe on the basis of the neoliberal character of the project and effectively cue voters against the EU on the basis of economic insecurity arguments.

I assess these in 27 parties in Canada, Australia, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the United States and Spain and investigate how parties respond to the incentives and opportunities created by their institutional environment. Clear patterns emerge between the form of federal state design and the predominant form of party organization: in decentralized federations with low coordination requirements between federal and state-level governments, a tendency can be found towards highly autonomous state parties. Where resources are centralized and intergovernmental coordination requirements are high, integrated parties with low autonomy can be found. However, neither aspect of institutional design has a significant relationship with 'upward' influence of state-level parties in the governance structure of federal parties. © 2009 SAGE Publications.",Decentralization; Federalism; Party organization; Political parties,,,,,,,,"Dawn B., The Origins and Strengths of Regional Parties, British Journal of Political Science, 38, pp. 135-59, (2008); Gerard B., Parties and Politics in Modern Germany, (1996); William C., Federalism and Political Parties, Federalism and the Role of the State, pp. 149-70, (1987); Pradeep C., Kollman K., The Formation of National Party Systems: Federalism and Party Competition in Canada, Great Britain, India and the United States, (2004); Cornelius C., Gibson J., Bibby J., Huckshorn R., Party Organization in American Politics, (1984); Scott D., The Impact of Federalism on National Political Parties in Brazil, Legislative Studies Quarterly, 29, pp. 259-85, (2004); Maurice D., Political Parties: Their Organization and Activity in the Modern State, (1963); Rand D., Links between Federal and Provincial Parties and Party Systems, Representation, Integration and Political Parties in Canada, pp. 129-77, (1991); Leon E., Political Parties in Western Democracies, (1967); Mikhail F., Ordeshook P., Shvetsova O., Designing Federalism: A Theory of Self-Sustainable Federal Institutions, (2004); James G., Cotter C., Bibby J., Huckshorn R., Assessing Party Organizational Strength, American Journal of Political Science, 27, pp. 193-222, (1983); Jorge G., Testing Riker's Party-Based Theory of Federalism: The Argentine Case, Publius, 34, pp. 21-34, (2004); Jonathan H., Political Decentralization, Electoral Change and Party Organizational Adaptation: A Framework for Analysis, European Urban and Regional Studies, 10, pp. 227-38, (2003); Robert H., Gibson J., Cotter C., Bibby J., Party Integration and Party Organizational Strength, Journal of Politics, 48, pp. 980-91, (1986); Larry K., Understanding Federalism, Vanderbilt Law Review, 47, pp. 1485-561, (1994); Larry K., Putting the Politics Back into the Political Safeguards of Federalism, Columbia Law Review, 100, pp. 215-93, (2000); Joseph L., Weiner M., The Origin and Development of Political Parties, Political Parties and Political Development, pp. 3-42, (1966); Kay L., The Comparative Study of Political Parties, (1976); Kurt L., Consociationalism, Parties and the Party System, West European Politics, 15, pp. 45-98, (1992); Wolfgang M., Austria, Party Organizations: A Data Handbook on Party Organizations in Western Democracies, 1960-1990, pp. 21-120, (1992); Wolfgang M., Austrian Governmental Institutions: Do They Matter?, West European Politics, 15, pp. 99-131, (1992); Angelo P., Political Parties: Organization and Power, (1988); Thomas P., Boll B., Germany, Party Organizations: A Data Handbook on Party Organizations in Western Democracies, 1960-1990, pp. 317-88, (1992); Thomas P., Alternative Politics: The German Green Party, (1993); William R., The Senate and, American Federalism', American Political Science Review, 49, pp. 452-69, (1955); William R., Federalism: Operation, Origin, Significance, (1964); Fritz S., Federal Arrangements and Multi-Party Systems, Australian Journal of Political Science, 30, pp. 27-39, (1995); Eric S., New Labour in Britain: New Democratic Centralism, ' West European Politics, 25, pp. 147-70, (2002); Donald S., The Federal Condition in Canada, (1987); Lori T., Comparing Federal Institutions: Power and Representation in Six Federations, West European Politics, 26, pp. 1-22, (2003); Ronald W., Administration in Federal Systems, (1970); Watts Ronald L., Comparing Federal Systems, (1999); Kenneth W., Federal Government, (1953)","L.

A key question is: do electoral pressures from anti-immigration parties have a 'contagion' impact on other parties' immigration policy positions? In this article, I argue and empirically demonstrate that this is the case. On the basis of a comparative-empirical study of 75 parties in 11 Western European countries, I conclude that this contagion effect involves entire party systems rather than the mainstream right only. In addition, I find that opposition parties are more vulnerable to this contagion effect than parties in government. The findings of this article imply that anti-immigration parties are able to influence policy output in their political systems without entering government. © 2010 SAGE Publications.",anti-immigration parties; elections; immigration; Western Europe,,,,,,,,"Adams J., Clark M., Ezrow L., Glasgow G., Are Niche Parties Fundamentally Different from Mainstream Parties?

These twin trends make it important to re-examine who is joining today's smaller parties. As parties shrink, do they attract a changed mixture of members, possibly with different political priorities? Using data from two sets of European surveys, our study investigates this question to study longitudinal change in party membership. The data show a growing gap between the age of party members and the general population. In most other respects, however, party members seem to be becoming more, not less, like their fellow citizens. This suggests that today's smaller but more powerful memberships still have the potential to help link their parties to a wider electoral base. © The Author(s) 2010.",Demographics; ideological distance; members; membership composition,,,,,,,,"Adams J., Merrill III S., Candidate and Party Strategies in Two-Stage Elections Beginning with a Primary, American Journal of Political Science, 52, pp. 344-359, (2008); Bruter M., Harrison S., The Future of Our Democracies, (2009); Caul M., Political Parties and the Adoption of Candidate Gender Quotas: A Cross-National Analysis, Journal of Politics, 63, pp. 1214-1229, (2001); Cross W., Young L., The Contours of Political Party Membership in Canada, Party Politics, 10, pp. 427-444, (2004); Cross W., Young L., Factors Influencing the Decision of the Young Politically Engaged to Join a Political Party, Party Politics, 14, pp. 345-369, (2008); Dalton R., Citizen Politics, (2005); Dalton R., Weldon S., Public Images of Political Parties, West European Politics, 28, pp. 931-951, (2005); Duverger M., Political Parties: Their Organization and Activity in the Modern State, Trans.

Using unique data from Estonia on candidates' personal vote-earning attributes, such as local birthplace and local-level political experience, this research note offers the first direct test of both of these assumptions. I find that candidates with local-level political experience tend to be electorally more successful, and, once in parliament, they are more likely to behave independently and break party unity. Local birthplace has no effect on either personal vote or party unity. These findings have clear policy implications for the electoral and legislative strategies of political parties. © 2010 SAGE Publications.",Candidates; Estonia; Incentives; Legislators; Party unity; Personal votes,,,,,,,,"Ames Barry, The Deadlock of Democracy in Brazil, (2001); Amorim Neto Octavio, Fabiano Santos, The Executive Connection: Presidentially Defined Factions and Party Discipline in Brazil, Party Politics, 7, pp. 213-234, (2001); Arter David, The Nordic Parliaments, (1984); Arter David, Democracy in Scandinavia: Consensual, Majoritarian Or Mixed?, (2006); Blais Andre, Elisabeth Gidengil, Agnieszka Dobrzinska, Neil Nevitte, Richard Nadeau, Does the Local Candidate Matter?

This article examines the state of party membership and activism across a wide spectrum of democratic countries and shows that membership is in decline in most of them. It tests two rival explanations of the decline using a cross-sectional multi-level analysis of data from the ISSP Citizenship survey of 2004. One hypothesis is that the decline is due to 'state capture', or excessive state regulation brought about by an ever-closer relationship between parties and the state which has the effect of stifling voluntary activity at the grassroots level. A second suggests that parties are being undermined by the growth of relatively new forms of participation, notably cheque book participation, and consumer and Internet participation. These provide alternative outlets for political action outside traditional forms of participation such as party involvement. There is evidence to support the first of these hypotheses, but not the second. © The Author(s) 2011.",comparative political participation; multi-level modelling; party regulation; party volunteers,,,,,,,,"Bartolini S., Mair P., Challenges to Contemporary Political Parties, Political Parties and Democracy, pp. 327-343, (2001); Bellah R., Madsen R., Sullivan W., Swindler A., Tipton S., Habits of the Heart, (1985); Brehm J., Rahn W., Individual-Level Evidence for the Causes and Consequences of Social Capital, American Journal of Political Science, 41, pp. 999-1023, (1997); Burnham K.P., Anderson D.R., Model Selection and Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, (1998); Clarke H.D., Sanders D., Stewart M.C., Whiteley P., Political Choice in Britain, (2004); Coleman J., Foundations of Social Theory, (1990); Dalton R.J., Citizen Politics, (2005); Dalton R.J., Wattenberg M.P., Parties Without Partisans: Political Change in Advanced Industrial Societies, (2000); Denver D., Hands G., Modern Constituency Electioneering, (1997); Detterbeck K., Cartel Parties in Western Europe?, Party Politics, 11, pp. 173-191, (2005); Epstein L., Political Parties in Western Democracies, (1967); Etzioni A., The Spirit of Community: Rights, Responsibilities and the Communitarian Agenda, (1995); Farrell D., Webb P., Political Parties as Campaigning Organizations, Parties without Partisans, (2000); Fukuyama F., Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity, (1995); Gallagher M., Mitchell P., The Politics of Electoral Systems, (2005); Gibson R., Ward S., Reinvigorating Democracy?, British Politics and the Internet, (2000); Green D.P., Gerber A.S., Get Out the Vote!, (2004); Huckfeldt R., Sprague J., Political Parties and Electoral Mobilization, Political Structure, Social Structure and the Party Canvass, American Political Science Review, 86, pp. 70-86, (1992); Jordan G., Maloney W., The Protest Business: Mobilizing Campaign Groups, (1997); Kaufmann D., Kraay A., Mastruzzi M., Governance Matters V: Aggregate and Individual Governance Indicators for 1996-2005, (2006); Katz R.S., Mair P., Bardi L., Et al., The Membership of Political Parties in European Democracies, 1960-1990, European Journal of Political Research, 22, pp. 329-345, (1992); Katz R.S., Mair P., Changing Models of Party Organization and Party Democracy: The Emergence of the Cartel Party, Party Politics, 1, pp. 5-28, (1995); Kopecky P., Mair P., Political Parties and Government, Political Parties in Africa, pp. 275-292, (2003); Lipset S.M., American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword, (1996); Mair P., Party Organizations: From Civil Society to the State, How Parties Organize, (1994); Mair P., van Biezen I., Party Membership in Twenty European Democracies, 1980-2000, Party Politics, 7, pp. 5-21, (2001); McKenzie R., British Political Parties, (1955); Critical Citizens, (1999); Norris P., A Virtuous Circle: Political Communications in Postindustrial Societies, (2000); Oates S., Owen D., Gibson R., The Internet and Politics: Citizens, Voters and Activists, (2006); Oliver J.E., City Size and Civic Involvement in Metropolitan America, American Political Science Review, 94, pp. 361-373, (2000); Olson M., The Rise and Decline of Nations: Economic Growth, Stagflation and Social Rigidities, (1982); Panebianco A., Political Parties: Organization and Power, (1988); Parry G., Moyser G., Day N., Political Participation and Democracy in Britain, (1992); Pattie C., Seyd P., Whiteley P., Citizenship in Britain; Values, Participation and Democracy, (2004); Peltzman S., Political Participation and Government Regulation, (1998); Pennings P., Hazan R., Democratizing Candidate Selection: Causes and Consequences, Party Politics, 7, pp. 267-275, (2001); Putnam R., Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy, (1993); Putnam R., Bowling Alone, (2000); Rapoport R.B., Stone W.J., Three's a Crowd: The Dynamic of Third Parties, Ross Perot and Republican Resurgence, (2006); Raudenbusch S.W., Bryk A.S., Heirachical Linear Models: Applications and Data Analysis Methods, (2002); Richardson J.J., Governing under Pressure: The Policy Process in a Post-Parliamentary Democracy, (1979); Scarrow S.E., Parties and Their Members, (1996); Scarrow S., Parties without Members?

Moreover, while the literature recognizes both anticipated sanctions and homogeneity of preferences as pathways to party unity, it ignores possibilities such as party loyalty and the division of labour within parliamentary parties. The article examines these different pathways to party unity on the basis of five waves of interviews with nearly all members of the Lower House of the Dutch parliament. The article finds least evidence for sanctions as a major determinant of party unity, with the possible exception of parties in the governing coalition. Homogeneity, loyalty and division of labour all seem to play an important role. Party unity might seem over determined, but the more likely explanation offered is that it is a case of 'different horses for different courses'. © The Author(s) 2010.",administering discipline; elite respondents; legislative cohesion; legislators; The Netherlands,,,,,,,,"Andeweg R.B., Irwin G.A., Governance and Politics of the Netherlands, (2009); Becher M., Sieberer U., Discipline, Electoral Rules and Defection in the Bundestag 1983-94, German Politics, 17, pp. 293-304, (2008); Bowler S., Parties in Legislature: Two Competing Explanations, Parties without Partisans, pp. 157-179, (2000); Bowler S., Farrell D.M., Katz R.S., Party Cohesion, Party Discipline, and Parliaments, Party Discipline and Parliamentary Government, pp. 3-22, (1999); Carey J.M., Legislative Voting and Accountability, (2009); Cowley P., Stuart M., Sodomy, Slaughter, Sunday Shopping and Seatbelts: Free Votes in the House of Commons, 1979 to 1996, Party Politics, 3, pp. 119-130, (1997); Cox G.W., McCubbins M.D., Legislative Leviathan; Party Government in the House, (1993); Crowe E., Consensus and Structure in Legislative Norms: Party Discipline in the House of Commons, Journal of Politics, 45, pp. 907-931, (1983); Crowe E., The Web of Authority: Party Loyalty and Social Control in the British House of Commons, Legislative Studies Quarterly, 11, pp. 161-185, (1986); Depauw S., Parliamentary Party Cohesion and the Scarcity of Sanctions in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives (1991-1995), Res Publica, 41, pp. 15-39, (1999); Ferrara F., Frogs, Mice and Mixed Electoral Institutions: Party Discipline in Italy's XIV Chamber of Deputies, Journal of Legislative Studies, 10, pp. 10-46, (2004); Gallagher M., Conclusion, Candidate Selection in Comparative Perspective, pp. 236-284, (1988); Hazan R., Does Cohesion Equal Discipline?

However, so far there has been no attempt to provide a concise, measureable definition of the niche-party concept. In this article I argue that niche parties are best defined as parties that compete primarily on a small number of non-economic issues. The occurrence of niche parties is then operationalized and measured using issue salience information provided by expert surveys and manifesto data.

We test two main hypotheses: First, we expect that mainstream parties will exploit anti-immigrant sentiments in the electorate regardless of extreme right competition. This would indicate that the extreme Right is not the only driving force behind the recent 'anti-immigrant turn' of electoral politics in Western Europe. Second, we expect the mainstream Left to become increasingly critical towards immigration as its mainstream and/or extreme right competitors intensify their populist rhetoric. Being 'tough' on immigration is thus not a prerogative of the Right.

The analysis of a new data-set on the media coverage of national elections in six Western European countries serves to reinforce this overall rather sceptical conclusion. The analysis shows that, in the national elections in the six countries covered (Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom [UK]), there is no general trend to increasing personalization or increasing concentration of the media coverage on a limited set of particularly visible personalities. Among the six countries, the exception to this overall assessment is the Netherlands, where we find both a trend towards increasing personalization and increasing concentration of the public attention on a limited set of personalities. Rather than an increasing level of personalization, what we generally observe are large country-specific differences in the overall degree of personalization and of the concentration of attention on the top candidates. © The Author(s) 2011.",media systems; national election campaigns; personalization; presidentialization; Western European party systems,,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SFB 536); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (100012-111756/1+2, 1214-68010.02); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","The author acknowledges the joint support of the German Research Foundation (SFB 536 – Project C5), and of the Swiss National Science Foundation (1214-68010.02 and 100012-111756/1+2).

Micro-blogging in general, and Twitter in particular, is one of the new and popular Web 2.0 applications, yet there has been little research focusing on the use of Twitter by politicians. After reviewing different types of campaigning strategies and introducing a new and distinct strategy, this descriptive and exploratory study focuses on political candidates' use of micro-blogging and online social networking (i.e. Twitter) from a longitudinal, social network, and ideological perspective. The results clearly show that most candidates in 2009 still used Twitter reluctantly. Those who used Twitter did so predominantly for electoral campaigning and only sparingly for continuous campaigning. Candidates from progressive parties are the most active users of Twitter as a campaigning tool, whereas conservatives are virtually absent online. Although candidates' first degree networks are still relatively small and unconnected, their second degree networks are quite extensive. Candidates from parties in opposition have more extensive first degree networks than those from ruling parties. Candidates from fringe parties show small online networks. © The Author(s) 2011.",elections; political campaigning; social networking; Web 2.0,,,,,,"World Class University; Ministry of Education, MOE, (515-82-06574); Ministry of Education, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF",This research was supported by WCU (World Class University) programme through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education and Technology (No. 515-82-06574).,"Online, (2010); Andeweg R.B., Parliamentary Democracy in the Netherlands, Parliamentary Affairs, 57, pp. 568-580, (2004); Boyd D.M., Ellison N.B., Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13, pp. 210-230, (2007); Blumenthal S., The Permanent Campaign, (1982); Caprara G.V., Barbaranelli C., Zimbardo P.G., Personality Profiles and Political Parties, Political Psychology, 20, pp. 175-197, (1999); Carey J.M., Shugart M.S., Incentives to Cultivate a Personal Vote: A Rank Ordering of Electoral Formulas, Electoral Studies, 14, pp. 417-439, (1995); Chen P., Adoption and Use of Digital Media in Election Campaigns: Australia, Canada and New Zealand, Public Communication Review, 1, pp. 3-26, (2010); Cormode G., Krishnamurthy B., Key Differences Between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, (2008); Creswell J.W., Clark V.L.P., Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research, (2007); de Vreese C.H., Banducci S.A., Semetko H.A., Boomgaarden H.G., The News Coverage of the 2004 European Parliamentary Election Campaign in 25 Countries, European Union Politics, 7, pp. 477-504, (2006); Esser F., de Vreese C.H., Comparing Young Voters' Political Engagement in the United States and Europe, American Behavioral Scientist, 50, pp. 1195-1213, (2007); Results of the 2009 European Elections, (2009); Flickinger R.S., Studlar D.T., One Europe, Many Electorates?

Is their mere inclusion in the democratic process enough to result in their moderation? If so, exactly what mechanisms are at work here? What roles are played by intervening variables such as coalition politics and electoral systems? And if this is not the case, what other variables may explain the movements of religious parties along the axis between moderation and radicalization? Does religion itself play a role? In the endeavor to answer these and related questions, this introduction to the Special Issue on Religious Parties initially provides some conceptual clarifications and offers an overview of the relevant literature. It is followed by a list of conditions under which the development and shift of religious parties towards ideological and behavioral moderation may be expected. The argument posits that the democratization of the political system and inclusion in electoral competition are not the sole determining factors. Inclusion, indeed, seems to be neither a necessary nor sufficient condition. The four case studies presented after the introduction (by Carolyn Warner, Michael Buehler, Steven T. Wuhs, and Sarah Wilson Sokhey/Kadir Yildirim) analyze this in more depth by working diachronically and across parties of different religions.

It has been argued that populism is not necessarily the prerogative of populist parties; it has been adopted by mainstream parties as well. The article investigates whether populism is contagious. On the basis of the results of a content analysis of election manifestos of parties in five Western European countries (France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom), we conclude that the programmes of mainstream parties have not become more populist in recent years. We find no evidence that mainstream parties change their programmes when confronted with electoral losses or successful populist challengers. Yet, we do find that populist parties change their own programmes when they have been successful: Their initial success makes them tone down their populism. © The Author(s) 2012.",content analysis; mainstream parties; populism,,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","This work is part of the research programmes ‘Newly Governing Parties: Success or Failure?’ (dossiernummer 016-115-060) and ‘Political Legitimacy and Transformations of Party Democracy’ (dossiernummer 311-99-110), which are financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).

We start by proposing definitions of the types and subtypes of centralized and decentralized personalization and review the literature in search of evidence of their occurrence.

As his collaborators on this piece, it seems pertinent that we take these findings as a point of departure and discuss what they mean for our understanding of party democracy. After all, the collapse of membership figures calls into question one of the central elements of our conceptualization of representative democracy, namely that it is based on voluntary political participation within political parties. All authoritative typologies of political parties consider the role of members to be one of their defining elements, although the cartel party most clearly envisages the marginalization of party members by professional party politicians. The traditional organizational allies of political parties (e.g. trade unions, organized religion) are subject to similar processes of erosion. In this article, we review the evidence of the social anchorage of political parties and discuss how political parties and party democracy can survive in an age where amateur politicians are becoming an increasingly rare species and parties are being transformed into organizational vehicles for those to whom politics is a profession rather than a vocation. © The Author(s) 2014.",collateral organizations; linkage; organized interest; party membership; political participation,,,,,,,,"Albertazzi D., McDonnell D., The Lega Nord back in government, West European Politics, 33, pp. 1318-1340, (2010); Allern E.H., Political Parties and Interest Groups in Norway, (2010); Allern E.H., Bale T., Political parties and interest groups: Qualifying the common wisdom, Party Politics, 18, pp. 7-25, (2012); Andeweg R.B., Beyond representativeness?

As more researchers use CHES data to examine party competition and political representation (e.g. Adams et al., 2012 ; Bakker et al., 2012 ; Jolly, 2007 ; Karreth et al., 2013 ; van de Wardt, 2012 ), establishing the validity and reliability of expert placements is of key importance. Our results suggest that CHES data display quite high levels of inter-expert reliability and considerable common structure with different measures. This is good news for scholars aiming to examine the positions of parties on a variety of ideological and policy dimensions in a longitudinal and cross-national perspective.

After defining the practice through reference to the 2008 campaign of Barack Obama and online parties literature, we devise a measure of CIC that is applied to UK parties in the 2010 election. Our findings show that CIC is emerging outside the U.S. and adoption is associated with major party status, although it may be of particular appeal to political actors facing a resource deficit. The conclusions focus on the implications of CIC for new forms of party membership, indirect voter mobilization and the contextual factors influencing this new model of campaigning. © The Author(s) 2013.",Britain; campaign activities; members; Party Politics; using the Internet,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (RES-051-27-0299)"," The research presented in this article is funded by an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Professorial Fellowship RES-051-27-0299, ‘The Internet, Electoral Politics and Citizen Participation in Global Perspective’.

The article concludes that the impact of radical right parties on mainstream policy agendas tends to be overestimated. © The Author(s) 2012.",Electoral competition; immigration; mainstream parties; radical right parties,,,,,,"Andrea Volkens; Hans-Dieter Klingemann; Social Science Research Centre Berlin; Zentralarchiv für empirischeSozialforschung; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (480-42-005); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","In total, 176 manifestos were analysed.

They criticize mainstream parties for cutting and slashing welfare at the expense of the ‘native’ population and to the benefit of the ‘undeserving’ immigrant. Given the electoral success of populist parties, we investigate whether and when mainstream parties ignore, attack or accommodate welfare chauvinism. Using key theories of party behaviour, we test whether mainstream parties (1) respond immediately to populist parties, (2) respond with a time lag, or (3) respond only when they lose elections or are in opposition. Our quantitative analyses of party manifestos, speeches and policies of European mainstream and populist parties (1980–2012) show that mainstream parties adapt to populist parties on welfare chauvinism, but which parties adapt and when varies significantly. In our in-depth examinations of the Dutch and Danish cases, we highlight important cross-country and cross-party differences. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",party change; political parties; populism; welfare chauvinism,,,,,,,,"Abts K., Rummens S., Populism versus democracy, Political Studies, 55, 2, pp. 405-424, (2007); Afonso A., Choosing whom to betray: Populist right-wing parties, welfare state reforms and the trade-off between office and votes.

The project’s first round of data covers 122 parties in 19 countries. In this article, we describe the scope of the database, then investigate what it tells us about contemporary party organization in these countries, focusing on parties’ resources, structures and internal decision-making. We examine organizational patterns by country and party family, and where possible we make temporal comparisons with older data sets. Our analyses suggest a remarkable coexistence of uniformity and diversity. In terms of the major organizational resources on which parties can draw, such as members, staff and finance, the new evidence largely confirms the continuation of trends identified in previous research: that is, declining membership, but enhanced financial resources and more paid staff. We also find remarkable uniformity regarding the core architecture of party organizations. At the same time, however, we find substantial variation between countries and party families in terms of their internal processes, with particular regard to how internally democratic they are, and the forms that this democratization takes. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",intra-party democracy; party finance; party membership; party organization; party strength,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1419401); National Science Foundation, NSF; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/L016613/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC",,"Bagehot W., The English Constitution, (1867); von dem Berge B., Poguntke T., Varieties of intra-party democracy: conceptualization and index construction, Organizing Representation: Political Parties, Participation, and Power, (2017); von dem Berge B., Poguntke T., Obert P., Et al., Measuring Intra-Party Democracy.

We analyse the electoral breakthroughs of AERPs in central and eastern Europe (CEE), the region where AERPs have so far been most successful. Examples include the Simeon II National Movement, Movement for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) (Bulgaria), Res Publica (Estonia), New Era (Latvia), TOP09 and Public Affairs (Czech Republic) and Positive Slovenia. We examine the conditions under which such parties broke through in nine CEE states in 1997–2012 using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). We find five sufficient causal paths combining high or rising corruption, rising unemployment and party system instability. Rising corruption plays a key role in most pathways but, unexpectedly, AERP breakthroughs are more closely associated with economic good times than bad. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",corruption; eastern Europe; new parties; party system change; QCA,,,,,,,,"Abedi A., Anti-Political Establishment Parties: A Comparative Analysis, (2004); Bagenholm A., The electoral fate and policy impact of ‘anti-corruption parties’ in Central and Eastern Europe, Human Affairs, 23, 2, pp. 174-195, (2013); Bagenholm A., Throwing the rascals out?

Are right-wing parties more populist than left-wing parties? Based on the analysis of 32 parties in five Western European countries between 1989 and 2008, we show that radical parties on both the left and the right are inclined to employ a populist discourse. This is a striking finding, because populism in Western Europe has typically been associated with the radical right; only some particular radical left parties have been labeled populist as well. This article suggests that the contemporary radical left in Western Europe is generally populist. Our explanation is that many contemporary radical left parties are not traditionally communist or socialist (anymore). They do not focus on the ‘proletariat’, but glorify a more general category: the ‘good people’. Moreover, they do not reject the system of liberal democracy as such, but only criticize the political and/or economic elites within that system. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",Populism; radical left; radical right; Western Europe,,,,,,,,"Akkerman T., The impact of radical right parties in government: A comparative analysis of immigration and integration policies in nine countries (1996–2010), West European Politics, 35, 3, pp. 511-529, (2012); Akkerman T., De Lange S.L., Radical right parties in office: Incumbency records and the electoral cost of governing, Government and Opposition, 47, 4, pp. 574-596, (2012); Albertazzi D., McDonnell D., Introduction: The sceptre and the spectre, Twenty-First Century Populism, pp. 1-11, (2008); Albertazzi D., McDonnell D., The Lega Nord back in government, West European Politics, 33, 6, pp. 1318-1340, (2010); Albertazzi D., McDonnell D., Newell J.L., Di lotta e di governo: The Lega Nord and Rifondazione Comunista in office, Party Politics, 17, 4, pp. 471-487, (2011); Arzheimer K., Contextual factors and the extreme right vote in Western Europe 1980–2002, American Journal of Political Science, 53, 2, pp. 259-275, (2009); Barr R.R., Populists, outsiders and anti-establishment politics, Party Politics, 15, 1, pp. 29-48, (2009); Belanger E., Aarts K., Explaining the rise of the LPF: Issues, discontent, and the 2002 Dutch election, Acta Politica, 41, pp. 4-20, (2006); Bos L., Van der Brug W., De Vreese C., How the media shape perceptions of right-wing populist leaders, Political Communication, 28, 2, pp. 182-206, (2011); Budge I., Klingemann H.-D., Volkens A., Et al., Mapping Policy Preferences: Estimates for Parties, Electors, and Governments 1945–1998, (2001); Canovan M., Taking politics to the people: Populism as the ideology of democracy, Democracies and the Populist Challenge, pp. 25-44, (2002); Canovan M., Populism for political theorists?, Journal of Political Ideologies, 9, 3, pp. 241-252, (2004); De la Torre C., Populist Seduction in Latin America, (2010); De Vries C.E., Edwards E.E., Taking Europe to its extremes: Extremist parties and public Euroscepticism, Party Politics, 15, 1, pp. 5-28, (2009); Deegan-Krause K., Haughton T., Toward a more useful conceptualization of populism: Types and degrees of populist appeals in the case of Slovakia, Politics & Policy, 37, 4, pp. 821-841, (2009); Freeden M., Is nationalism a distinct ideology?, Political Studies, 46, 4, pp. 748-765, (1998); Hakhverdian A., Koop C., Consensus democracy and support for populist parties in Western Europe, Acta Politica, 42, 4, pp. 401-420, (2007); Halikiopoulou D., Nanou K., Vasilopoulou S., The paradox of nationalism: The common denominator of radical right and radical left Euroscepticism, European Journal of Political Research, 51, 4, pp. 504-539, (2012); Harmel R., Janda K., An integrated theory of party goals and party change, Journal of Theoretical Politics, 6, 3, pp. 259-287, (1994); Hawkins K.A., Is Chávez populist?

Nevertheless, party system institutionalization is not something that can be gained once and for all. This article proposes a theoretical reconceptualization and a new empirical operationalization of party system (de-)institutionalization. Furthermore, it tests the presence of patterns of de-institutionalization in Western Europe from 1945 to (March) 2015 (336 elections in 19 countries) by using an original database of electoral volatility and of its internal components (regeneration and alteration).

The key finding is that Eurosceptic challenger support is capable of influencing mainstream position shifts on European integration provided that, on average, EU issues are regarded as important by the Eurosceptic challengers. Moreover, the centre-left is more affected by Eurosceptic contagion since it is influenced by both radical right and radical left Eurosceptic success, whereas the centre-right is only susceptible to radical right success. The empirical analyses are based on panel regression analysis employing expert survey data provided by Chapel Hill Expert Survey. The findings presented in this article have important implications for the study of party positioning on European integration as well as for the study of party competition in general. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",European Union; Euroscepticism; party adaptation; political parties; statistical analysis,,,,,,,,"Abou-Chadi T., Niche party success and mainstream party policy shifts: How green and far-right parties differ in their impact, British Journal of Political Science, pp. 1-20, (2014); Adams J., Causes and electoral consequences of party policy shifts in multiparty elections: Theoretical results and empirical evidence, Annual Review of Political Science, 15, 1, pp. 401-419, (2012); Adams J., Clark M., Ezrow L., Et al., Are niche parties fundamentally different from mainstream parties?

To understand the emerging conflict structures, it argues for the need to consider that these countries simultaneously face an economic crisis and a political crisis and that both crises have strong domestic and European components. Moreover, the major driving forces of change tend to be social movements and political parties that forcefully combine opposition to austerity and to “old politics.” This leads to a complex conflict structure shaped by struggles over austerity and political renewal. In this structure, divides over economic and political issues are closely aligned with each other. While this pattern emerges everywhere, there are distinct country differences. Empirically, the article relies on original data from a large-scale content analysis of national election campaigns in the four countries in the period 2011 to 2015. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",economic crisis; new left; party competition; political crisis; Southern Europe,,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC; European Commission, EC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (338875)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the ERC Project \u201CPolitical Conflict in Europe in the Shadow of the Great Recession\u201D (Project ID: 338875).","Afonso A., Zartaloudis S., Papadopoulos Y., How party linkages shape austerity politics: clientelism and fiscal adjustment in Greece and Portugal during the Eurozone crisis, Journal of European Public Policy, 22, 3, pp. 315-334, (2014); Altiparmakis A., Lorenzini J., Disclaiming national representatives: protest waves in Southern Europe during the crisis, Party Politics, 24, 1, pp. 78-89, (2018); Akkerman T., Immigration policy and electoral competition in Western Europe: a fine-grained analysis of party positions over the past two decades, Party Politics, 21, 1, pp. 54-67, (2015); Beramendi P., Hausermann S., Kitschelt H., Et al., Introduction, The Politics of Advanced Capitalism, pp. 1-64, (2015); Biorcio R., The reasons for the success and transformations of the 5 star movement, Contemporary Italian Politics, 6, 1, pp. 37-53, (2014); Biorcio R., Il Populismo Nella Politica Italiana : Da Bossi a Berlusconi, Da Grillo a Renzi, (2015); Bobba G., McDonnell D., Italy: a strong and enduring market for populism, European Populism in the Shadow of the Great Recession, pp. 163-179, (2015); Borghetto E., Russo F., From agenda setters to agenda takers?

Creating a novel measure of parties’ climate change salience based on Comparative Manifesto Project data, the article finds that parties have broadly not made climate change a salient issue, though significant differences remain. Left–right ideology significantly helps explain these differences and is more important than any other party characteristic in explaining the variation. This underlines the importance of ideology over economic and policy preferences, size and strategic incentives and incumbency constraints and points towards the partisan (as opposed to the valence) nature of the climate change issue. These results contrast to those of an identical analysis of environmental salience where ideology is found to have no effect, underlining how the two issues should be treated differently and lending further support to the argument that climate change is not a valence issue. © The Author(s) 2017.",climate change; content analysis; environment; political parties; valence,,,,,,,,"Abou-Chadi T., Orlowski M., Moderate as necessary: the role of electoral competitiveness and party size in explaining parties’ policy shifts, The Journal of Politics, 78, 3, pp. 868-881, (2016); Bakker R., Edwards E., Hooghe L., Et al., 2014 Chapel Hill Expert Survey Version 2015.1, (2015); Batstrand S., Giving content to new politics: from broad hypothesis to empirical analysis using Norwegian manifesto data on climate change, Party Politics, 20, 6, pp. 930-939, (2014); Batstrand S., More than markets: a comparative study of nine conservative parties on climate change, Politics and Policy, 43, 4, pp. 538-5561, (2015); Bernauer T., Bohmelt T., Koubi V., Is there a democracy–civil society paradox in global environmental governance?, Global Environmental Politics, 13, 1, pp. 88-107, (2013); Bomberg E., Green Parties and Politics in the European Union, (1998); Budge I., Mapping policy preferences: 21 years of the comparative manifestos project, European Political Science, 1, 3, pp. 60-68, (2002); Carter N., Party politicization of the environment in Britain, Party Politics, 12, 6, pp. 747-767, (2006); Carter N., Greening the mainstream: party politics and the environment, Environmental Politics, 22, 1, pp. 73-94, (2013); Carter N., Clements B., From ‘greenest government ever’ to ‘get rid of all the green crap’: David Cameron, the conservatives and the environment, British Politics, 10, pp. 204-225, (2015); Dalton R., Citizen Politics, (2002); Dalton R., Economics, environmentalism and party alignments: a note on partisan change in advanced industrial democracies, European Journal of Political Research, 48, 2, pp. 161-175, (2009); Dalton R., Flanagan S., Beck P., Electoral Change in Advanced Industrial Democracies, (1984); De Vries C.E., Hobolt S.B., When dimensions collide: the electoral success of issue entrepreneurs, European Union Politics, 13, 2, pp. 246-268, (2012); Dunlap R.E., McCright A.M., A widening gap: republican and democratic views on climate change, Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, 50, pp. 26-35, (2008); Dunlap R.E., McCright A.M., Yarosh J.H., The political divide on climate change: partisan polarization widens in the U.S, Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, 58, 5, pp. 4-23, (2016); Dunlap R.E., Xiao C., McCright A.M., Politics and environment in America, Environmental Politics, 10, 4, pp. 23-48, (2001); Eckersley R., Poles apart?

Due to the party’s criticism, its charismatic leadership, and its aggressive electoral campaigns, the M5S has been labeled as a populist. The unexpected result of 2013 election raises crucial theoretical questions: To what extent does the M5S electorate reflect the characteristics of a protest vote? To what extent was it also a vote driven by values, by individual evaluations on a specific political issue? The first part of the article aims to investigate the extent of negative political feelings among M5S’ voters. To disentangle the meaning and impact of protest, we distinguish two dimensions: the “system discontent” and the “élite discontent,” referring to both general and focalized images, sentiments toward and the representation of political institutions, voter power, and government performances. In the second part, we bring to the analysis a further explanation based on the theory of issue voting. The goal is to measure whether voters have chosen M5S purely because of their political resentment or also given that they shared a similar position on a number of crucial policies emphasized in the electoral campaign. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Five Star Movement; issue voting; political parties; populism; protest voting,,,,,,,,"Albertazzi D., McDonnell D., Populist in Power, (2015); Bergh J., Protest voting in Austria, Denmark and Norway, Scandinavian Political Studies, 27, 4, pp. 367-389, (2004); Almond G.A., Powell B.G., Comparative Politics.

Within this literature, an underlying assumption is that immigration has become one of the most salient issues. However, this is rarely documented, let alone explained. Drawing on a new coding of party manifestos in seven West European countries, this article shows that party attention to immigration has grown in all countries since 1980 but only in Denmark has the issue become one of the most salient issues of party politics. We find that the general increase in attention reflects the rising number of immigrants and rise of radical right-wing parties. In terms of the issue becoming a top issue of party politics, a comparative analysis of the politicization of immigration in Denmark and the Netherlands shows that the interest of mainstream right-wing parties and coalition dynamics are the crucial factors. © The Author(s) 2017.",coalition dynamics; immigration; issue competition; politicization; Western Europe,,,,,,,,"Abou-Chadi T., Niche party success and mainstream party policy shifts, British Journal of Political Science, 46, 2, pp. 417-436, (2016); Abou-Chadi T., Political and institutional determinants of immigration policies, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 42, 13, pp. 2087-2110, (2016); Akkerman T., Comparing radical right parties in government: immigration and integration policies in nine countries (1996–2010), West European Politics, 35, 3, pp. 511-529, (2012); Alonso S., da Fonseca S.C., Immigration, left and right, Party Politics, 18, 6, pp. 865-884, (2012); Andersen J.G., The general election in Denmark, November 2001, Electoral Studies, 22, 1, pp. 186-193, (2003); Bakker R., de Vries C., Edwards E., Et al., Measuring party positions in Europe: the Chapel Hill expert survey trend file 1999–2010, Party Politics, 21, 1, pp. 143-152, (2015); Bale T., Cinderella and her ugly sisters: the mainstream and extreme right in Europe’s bipolarising party systems, West European Politics, 26, 3, pp. 67-90, (2003); Bale T., Turning round the telescope: centre-right parties and immigration and integration policy in Europe, Journal of European Public Policy, 15, 3, pp. 315-330, (2008); Bale T., Green-Pedersen C., Krouwel A., Et al., If you can’t beat them, join them?: explaining social democratic responses to the challenge from the populist radical right in western Europe, Political Studies, 58, 3, pp. 410-426, (2010); Baumgartner F.R., Jones B.D., The politics of information: problem definition and the course of public policy in America, (2015); Bevan S., Gone fishing: the creation of the comparative agendas project master codebook, (2014); Castles F.G., Mair P., Left-right political scales: some expert judgments, European Journal of Political Research, 12, 1, pp. 73-88, (1984); De Lange S., New alliances: why mainstream parties govern with radical right-wing populist parties, Political Studies, 60, 4, pp. 899-918, (2012); Doring H., Manow P., Parliament and government composition database (ParlGov): an infrastructure for empirical information on parties, elections and governments in modern democracies, (2012); Green-Pedersen C., Partier I Nye Tider, (2012); Green-Pedersen C., Krogstrup J., Immigration as a political issue in Denmark and Sweden.

Although this is an obvious observation, it has received little attention in the study of populism—a set of ideas that not only portrays established political parties as corrupt and self-serving entities but also depicts “the people” as a homogenous and virtuous community that should run the government. In this contribution, we develop a novel theory that claims that populism can thrive only when an antiestablishment political identity exists. This identity denotes an emotional and rational repulsion toward all established political parties in a given country. We test our theory by analyzing original survey data from contemporary Chile. The empirical analysis reveals not only that a limited segment of the electorate holds an antiestablishment political identity coalesced by populism but also that there is a large segment of apartisans adverse to populism. These empirical findings have important consequences for the study of populism, particularly when it comes to analyzing its emergence and electoral potential. © The Author(s) 2017.",Chile; comparative politics; political identities; populism; voting behavior,,,,,,"Chilean Millennium Science Initiative, (CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009, NS130008); Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT, (1140101, 1161262)","Funding text 1: Carlos Meléndez acknowledges support from the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT project 1161262), and the Chilean Millennium Science Initiative (project NS 130008).; Funding text 2: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser acknowledges support from the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT project 1140101), the Chilean Millennium Science Initiative (project NS130008), and the Center for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES, CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009).","Abedi A., Anti-political Establishment Parties: A Comparative Analysis, (2004); Abramowitz A., Webster S., The rise of negative partisanship and the nationalization of U.S. elections in the 21st century, Electoral Studies, 41, pp. 12-22, (2016); Achen C., Bartels L., Democracy for realists, Why Elections Do Not Produce Responsive Government, (2016); Aguilar R., Carlin R.E., Ideational populism in Chile?

We argue that a key political decision on immigration in 2004 facilitated the emergence of a new dimension of party competition and growth in popular support for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) leading eventually to the 2016 EU Referendum. To examine this thesis, we trace the impact of the UK government’s immigration policy on (i) rising immigration, (ii) the political salience of immigration, (iii) the increasing association between concern about immigration and Euroscepticism, and (iv) the emergence of a cross-cutting dimension of party competition coalescing around support for UKIP. The analysis combines information from official immigration rates, media reporting on immigration, Mori polls, continuous monitoring surveys, and the British Election Study. © The Author(s) 2018.",Brexit; Euroscepticism; immigration; UKIP,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/K005294/1, ES/L005166/1, ES/P001734/1)",,"Adams J., Clark M., Ezrow L., Et al., Are niche parties fundamentally different from mainstream parties?

How can party values be measured in consistent, valid, and reliable ways, facilitating identification of varieties of populism in countries around the world? To address this issue, part I outlines the conceptual framework. Part II describes the research design. The Global Party Survey (GPS) replicates previous expert surveys, expands coverage worldwide, and incorporates innovative scaled measures of populism. It draws upon estimates from 1861 experts and covers 1043 political parties in 163 countries (see www.GlobalPartySurvey.org). Part III summarizes some key cross-national results. Part IV presents robustness tests which confirm that the new GPS estimates of ideological values and populist parties are consistently correlated with several previous measures. The conclusion in part V summarizes the main findings and considers the potential uses of the data set for understanding populism as a global phenomenon. © The Author(s) 2020.",classifying political parties; expert survey methods; ideological typologies; measuring populism,,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The survey was funded by the Australian Research Council.

In a nutshell, I argue that parties are now at pains to retain their linkages with society, and that the compensation they envisaged has further damaged them. To respond to sociocultural and economic changes which had weakened parties both in their organizational standing and in their public reputation, parties took a dual route: They went to the state to acquire financial resources and profit in other ways; and they introduced direct democracy practices inside the parties themselves. After discussing how parties have reacted to the changing environment, the article concentrates on intra-party organizational modifications and deals with three basic questions: (a) Why did parties attempt to democratize? (b) What outcome did the democratization, in terms of members’ direct intervention, produce? (c) Is democracy at stake because of the negative impact of the parties’ change and their consequent, persisting, crisis of legitimacy? © The Author(s) 2018.",Democracy; individualization; legitimacy; political party; post-industrial society,,,,,,,,"Achen C., Bartels L., Democracy for Realists: Why Elections Do Not Produce Responsive Government, (2016); Aylott N., Bolin N., Managed intra-party democracy: precursory delegation and party leader selection, Party Politics, 23, 1, pp. 55-65, (2017); Bardi L., Bartolini S., Treschel A., Responsive and responsible?

Mair argued that political parties find it increasingly difficult to balance these two tasks. With an increase in international commitments and interdependence, governments cannot always follow the wishes of their citizens but need to be responsible instead. Our study examines the responsiveness–responsibility link from the angle of citizen perceptions. We argue that when governments are seen as responsive they build a “buffer” of support, allowing them to make decisions that are not necessarily responsive but possibly responsible. By being responsive, governments build a reservoir of goodwill, which they can use to survive more difficult periods. Using data from the 2012 European Social Survey, we test whether perceived responsiveness feeds into this reservoir and whether this reservoir consequently increases perceived responsibility. We find support for this link, suggesting that responsiveness and responsibility do not need to be trade-offs but can complement each other. © The Author(s) 2018.",legitimacy; political support; responsibility; responsiveness; satisfaction with democracy,,,,,,"Norges Forskningsråd, (262986); Norges Forskningsråd; Bergens Forskningsstiftelse, (811309); Bergens Forskningsstiftelse","The authors would like to thank Mark Bovens, Stefan Dahlberg, Zoe Lefkofridi, Jan Karremans, Rubén Ruiz-Rufino, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions on earlier versions of this article.

A theory-upending case, the country has descended into a competitive authoritarian regime under the Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi—AKP), despite rising income and education levels and strong links with the West. What accounts for democratic breakdown in such an unlikely case? Instead of ideological and institutional factors, we offer a political economy account. We contend that the coalitional ties that the AKP forged with businesses and the urban poor through the distribution of public resources has altered the cost of toleration for the party leadership and their dependent clients, while reducing the cost of suppression for incumbents. This new political calculus led to increasing authoritarianism of the AKP government through securitization of dissent, mounting repression, and systematic violation of civil liberties. © The Author(s) 2020.",AKP; clientelism; democratic breakdown; Recep Tayyip Erdoğan; Turkey,,,,,,,,"Acemoglu D., Robinson J.A., Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy, (2005); 2013 Yılı Faaliyet Raporu, (2014); Akdag G., Ethnicity and Elections in Turkey: Party Politics and the Mobilization of Swing Voters, (2014); Akkoyunlu K., Oktem K., Existential insecurity and the making of a weak authoritarian regime in Turkey, Southeast European and Black Sea Studies, 16, 4, pp. 505-527, (2016); Kamu Ihale Kanunu yine degisiyor. 15 January, (2015); Almond G.A., Verba S., The Civic Culture: Political Attitudes and Democracy in Five Nations, (1963); Angrist M.P., Party systems and regime formation in the modern Middle East: explaining Turkish exceptionalism, Comparative Politics, 36, 2, pp. 229-249, (2004); Apaydin F., Financialization and the push for non-state social service provision: philanthropic activities of Islamic and conventional banks in Turkey, Forum for Development Studies, 42, 3, pp. 441-465, (2015); Ark-Yildirim C., Political parties and grassroots clientelist strategies in urban Turkey: one neighbourhood at a time, South European Society and Politics, 22, 4, pp. 473-490, (2017); Atiyas I., Economic institutions and institutional change in Turkey during the neoliberal era, New Perspectives on Turkey, 47, 1, pp. 57-81, (2012); Aytac S.E., Distributive politics in a multiparty system: the conditional cash transfer program in Turkey, Comparative Political Studies, 47, 9, pp. 1211-1237, (2014); Aytac S.E., Schiumerini L., Stokes S., Protests and repression in new democracies, Perspectives on Politics, 15, 1, pp. 62-82, (2017); Baykan T.S., The Justice and Development Party in Turkey: Populism, Personalism, Organization, (2018); Bellin E., Contingent democrats: industrialists, labor, and democratization in late-developing countries, World Politics, 52, 2, pp. 175-205, (2000); Bermeo N., On democratic backsliding, Journal of Democracy, 27, 1, pp. 5-19, (2016); Boix C., Democracy and Redistribution, (2003); Boix C., Stokes S.C., Endogenous democratization, World Politics, 55, 4, pp. 517-549, (2003); Bozkurt U., Neoliberalism with a human face: making sense of the Justice and Development Party’s neoliberal populism in Turkey, Science & Society, 77, 3, pp. 372-396, (2013); Brownlee J., Why Turkey’s authoritarian descent shakes up democratic theory, Washington Post, (2016); Bugra A., Islam in Economic Organizations.

Existing studies tend to claim that populists support direct democracy because of their stealth-democratic orientation or argue that stealth democrats want direct democracy due to the populist nature of stealth-democratic attitudes. Yet, albeit both populists and stealth democrats reject elite rule, they prefer direct democracy for different reasons. Populists support direct democracy as a means to implement the volonté générale, whereas stealth democrats view it as holding politicians accountable for ineffective policy solutions. Our analysis of representative survey data in four European democracies (France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) reveals that individuals with stronger populist attitudes indeed support direct democracy more than citizens with no strong populist attitudes. This effect is observed when controlling for stealth-democratic orientations and when using a measure separating the feature populism shares with stealth democracy – anti-elitism – from the one unique to populism, people-centrism. © The Author(s) 2019.",anti-elitism; direct democracy; people-centrism; populism; stealth democracy,,,,,,"Comparative Politics; NCCR; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","The authors are greatly benefited from comments by our NCCR colleagues, especially Vally Koubi, Thomas Bernauer, Daniel Kübler and Sandra Lavenex as well as Paul Webb and three anonymous reviewers.

This term refers to a new wave of political organisations committed to transforming intra-party democracy (IPD) through the adoption of online ‘participatory platforms’, sections of their official websites where registered members can debate and decide on various issues. In this article, I assess the democratic quality of online participatory platforms in the Five Star Movement in Italy and Podemos in Spain, examining various features embedded in them – discussions and proposals, elections of party officials and candidates and referendums – and evaluating their degree of inclusiveness, centralisation and institutionalisation. I argue that contrary to their promise to introduce a more membership-controlled and inclusive democracy, IPD in digital parties is strongly top-down. What these formations offer is a plebiscitarian ‘reactive democracy’ where members have little say over the process and are mostly left with ratifying decisions taken by the party leadership. This state of affairs calls for a critical rethinking of digital technology’s potential for transforming IPD. © The Author(s) 2019.",digital democracy; digital parties; digital politics; Five Star Movement; intra-party democracy; participatory platforms; plebiscitarianism; Podemos,,,,,,,,"Alvarez R.M., Hall T.E., Electronic Elections: The Perils and Promises of Digital Democracy, (2010); Biondo N., Canestrari M., Supernova: Com’è stato Ucciso il Movimento 5 Stelle, (2018); Blitzer J., In Spain, politics via reddit, The New Yorker, (2014); Carty R.K., Parties as franchise systems: the stratarchical organizational imperative, Party Politics, 10, 1, pp. 5-24, (2004); Casaleggio D., How Italians learned to govern themselves through technology, The Huffington Post, (2017); Casaleggio D., The five star movement: an Italian revolution – Davide Casaleggio presents the Rousseau application, YouTube, (2018); Chadwick A., Internet Politics: States, Citizens, and New Communication Technologies, (2006); Coleman G., New mediation and direct representation: reconceptualizing representation in the digital age, New Media & Society, 7, 2, pp. 177-198, (2005); Cross W., Blais A., Who selects the party leader?, Party Politics, 18, 2, pp. 127-150, (2012); Cross W.P., Katz R.S., The Challenges of Intra-Party Democracy, (2013); Deseriis M., Direct parliamentarianism: an analysis of the political values embedded in Rousseau, the “operating system” of the Five Star Movement, 2017 Conference for E-Democracy and open government (CeDEM), pp. 15-25, (2017); Dryzek J.S., Deliberative Democracy and Beyond: Liberals, Critics, Contestations, (2000); Duverger M., Political Parties: Their Organization and Activity in the Modern State, (1959); Ferdinand P., The Internet, democracy and democratization, Democratization, 7, 1, pp. 1-17, (2000); Floridia A., Vignati R., Deliberativa, diretta o partecipativa?.

The Spanish political party Vox, born in 2013, is a good example of this phenomenon. This paper analyzes Vox’s Instagram posts for the party’s two last electoral campaigns previous to the two successive general elections held in Spain in 2019. After the collection, selection and quantification of these data, we carried out a qualitative analysis of the semantic networks created through the utilization of images, videos, texts, interactions, hashtags and emojis. Our findings identify five fundamental arguments: classic gender nationalism, anti-Muslim gender nationalism, delegitimization and ridicule of feminism, discrediting the concept of gender, and the idea that Vox is, in fact, the party that most advocates for women. An outstanding discursive strategy used throughout the sample is that of contrast and association. Signifiers with a strong positive signified and broad social acceptance (euphoric terms) are associated with this party and its political positions. In contrast, negatively charged signifiers and hate-instigating terms (dysphoric) are associated with feminism and the so-called “gender ideology.” © The Author(s) 2020.",anti-feminism; anti-genderism; gender ideology; Instagram; PRR (populist radical right); radical right; Spain general election 2019; Vox,,,,,,"State Program for the Promotion of Scientific and Technical Research of Excellence of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, (2018-2022)","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the State Program for the Promotion of Scientific and Technical Research of Excellence of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities.

This article examines this question utilizing the case of Turkey, a country in which a populist force has been in power for more than a decade. By analyzing populist attitudes among a nationally representative sample, we demonstrate that while the voters of the incumbent populist party (AKP) are less likely, compared to everyone else, to hold populist sentiments, the same voters are also substantially more likely to endorse conspiracy theories that center on malign foreign powers. This finding is relevant beyond Turkey, because it demonstrates that populist forces might be able to maintain popular support and thus stay in power for a long stretch of time by employing government propaganda to fuel an antagonism against conspiratorial foreign and global forces. © The Author(s) 2021.",comparative politics; conspiracy theory; democracy; populism; Turkey; voting behavior,,,,,,"COES, (ANID / FONDAP / 15130009); Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies; Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, (MPG190012); Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT, (1180020); Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser would like to acknowledge support from the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDECYT Project 1180020), the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies - COES (ANID / FONDAP / 15130009) and the Observatory for Socioeconomic Transformations (ANID / PCI / Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies / MPG190012).

While we have a good understanding of the dynamics of ideological competition between parties, we know less about how individuals or groups inside parties influence policy, leadership selection and coalition bargaining. These questions can only be answered if we can place individual politicians and sub-party groups like factions on the same dimensions as in inter-party competition. This task has been notoriously difficult, as most existing measures either work on the party level, or are in other ways determined by the party agenda. Social media is a new data source that allows analyzing positions of individual politicians in party-centered systems, as it is subject to limited party control. I apply canonical correspondence analysis to account for hierarchical data structures and estimate multidimensional positions of the Twitter accounts of 498 Members of the German Bundestag based on more than 800,000 tweets since 2017. To test the effect of intra-party actors on their relative ideological placement, I coded the faction membership of 247 Twitter users in the Bundestag. I show that Twitter text reproduces party positions and dimensions. Members of factions are more likely to represent their faction’s positions, both on the cultural and the economic dimension. © The Author(s) 2020.",factions; intra-party heterogeneity; social media; Twitter,,,,,,GESS; University of Mannheim’s Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the the University of Mannheim’s Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS).

Populism and conspiracy theories present a number of common traits – Manichaeanism, a sense of victimhood, and an ambivalence towards representative politics – and populists’ use of conspiracy theories is politically purposeful. Targeting a conspiring elite serves to vilify real or fictional opponents and/or shield populists from hostile attacks. Looking at three cases of populists in government – Orbán in Hungary, Trump in the United States, and Chávez in Venezuela – we examine the definition of conspiring elites (who), the circumstances under which conspiracy theories are propagated (when), and the ultimate purpose of conspiratorial framing (why).

Widely seen to have transformed political practice, it is often argued that data-driven campaigning is a force of significant democratic disruption because it contributes to a fragmentation of political discourse, undermines prevailing systems of electoral accountability and subverts ‘free’ and ‘fair’ elections. In this article, we present one of the very first cross-national analyses of data-driven campaigning by political parties. Drawing on empirical research conducted by experts in six advanced democracies, we show that the data-driven campaign practices seen to threaten democracy are often not manifest in party campaigns. Instead, we see a set of practices that build on pre-existing techniques and which are far less sophisticated than is often assumed. Indeed, we present evidence that most political parties lack the capacity to execute the hyper-intensive practices often associated with data-driven campaigning. Hence, while there is reason to remain alert to the challenges data-driven campaigning produces for democratic norms, we argue that this practice is not inherently disruptive, but rather exemplifies the evolving nature of political campaigning in the 21st century. © The Author(s) 2022.",campaigning; data; digital; Political parties,,,,,,"McMaster University; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/N01667X/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; European Commission, EC; Australian Research Council, ARC, (190100210); Australian Research Council, ARC; Canada Research Chairs, (950-231159); Canada Research Chairs; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO; Horizon 2020, (822166); Horizon 2020; Fiona Wood Foundation, FWF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (190100210), the Economic and Social Research Council (ES/N01667X/1), the Canada Research Chairs program (950-231159), McMaster University Faculty of Humanities, the NORFACE Joint Research Programme on Democratic Governance in a Turbulent Age and co-funded by ESRC, NWO, FWF and the European Commission through Horizon 2020 under grant agreement No 822166.”","Anstead N., Data-driven campaigning in the 2015 United Kingdom general election, The International Journal of Press/Politics, 22, pp. 294-313, (2017); Baldwin-Philippi J., The myths of data-driven campaigning, Political Communication, 34, pp. 627-633, (2017); Baldwin-Philippi J., Data campaigning: between empirics and assumptions, Internet Policy Review, 8, pp. 1-18, (2019); Bale T., Webb P., Poletti M., Footsoldiers: Political Party Membership in the 21st Century, (2019); Bennett C.J., Trends in voter surveillance in Western societies: privacy intrusions and democratic implications, Surveillance and Society, 13, 3, pp. 370-384, (2015); Bennett C., Bayley R., The Influence Industry in Canada, (2018); Bodo B., Helberger N., de Vreese C.H., Political micro-targeting: a Manchurian candidate or just a dark horse?, Internet Policy Review, 6, (2017); Broockman D., Kalla J., When and Why Are Campaigns’ Persuasive Effects Small?

These studies have mostly looked at support for citizens or independent experts being given a greater role. Recently, Hibbing, Theiss-Morse, Hibbing and Fortunato have proposed a new battery of 21 survey items capturing the dimensions along which citizens’ preferences for who should govern are organized. Testing their survey instrument among US respondents, they identified seven dimensions. In this study, we replicate their approach across nine European democracies, namely, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Ireland and the Netherlands. The replication allows, first, to compare citizens’ preferences for political actors between the US and Europe, and within Europe. Second, it provides suggestions for how Hibbing and colleagues’ battery might be adapted and re-used in other countries, enabling further cross-national comparative research on citizens’ preferences for who should govern. © The Author(s) 2023.",Democracy; democratic preferences; direct democracy; participatory democracy; public opinion; technocracy,,,,,,"; H2020 European Research Council, ERC, (772695)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is supported by H2020 European Research Council (grant agreement no. 772695).

We show that valence populist parties are non-positional and substantially different from both left-wing and right-wing populist parties. First, we demonstrate that valence populist parties deliberately take blurry positions on both the economic and socio-cultural dimensions of competition. Second, we show that such an ambiguity is counterbalanced by a disproportionate emphasis on anti-corruption appeals, the most paradigmatic example of a non-positional dimension.

Scholars tend to agree that the main threat to contemporary democracy arises from democratically elected rulers who gradually erode democratic norms. Is it possible to identify future autocratizers before they win power in elections? Linz (1978) and Levitsky and Ziblatt (2018) suggest that a lacking commitment to democratic norms reveals would-be autocratizers before they reach office. This article argues that the concept of anti-pluralism rather than populism or extreme ideology captures this. We use a new expert-coded data set on virtually all relevant political parties worldwide from 1970 to 2019 (V-Party) to create a new Anti-Pluralism Index (API) to provide the first systematic empirical test of this argument. We find substantial evidence validating that the API and Linz’s litmus-test indicators signal leaders and parties that will derail democracy if and when they come into power. © The Author(s) 2023.,anti-pluralism; autocratization; ideology; party rhetoric; populism,,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (724191); Universität Hamburg, UH, (1/2021); Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse, (2018.0144); Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2018–016114)","Funding text 1: This research was supported by Vetenskapsr\u00E5det [grant number 2018\u2013016114], PI: Anna L\u00FChrmann, Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation to Wallenberg Academy Fellow Staffan I.

The adoption of ethics self-regulation and its ability to induce change is likely to be a function of the responses from politicians and voters. Without external enforcement mechanisms, compliance requires support from legislators. In turn, if voters perceive self-regulation as cheap talk, officials have fewer incentives to acquiesce. The extent to which such efforts are rewarded by voters and supported by elected officials remains an open question. We examine this question in a paired conjoint experiment with elected officials and voters in Portugal and Spain. The results show that politicians support (and voters reward) financial disclosures, lobbying registries, and sanctions for MPs involved in corruption cases. Voters also reward term limits, and the effects are not moderated by ideological agreement. The findings suggest that parties can benefit from promoting transparency reforms and are not penalized by experimentation. © The Author(s) 2023.",corruption; financial disclosures; lobbying registries; party self-regulation; transparency,,,,,,"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (PTDC/CPO-CPO/28316/2017)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (PTDC/CPO-CPO/28316/2017), Funda\u00E7\u00E3o Francisco Manuel dos Santos.

Thus, the aim of this paper is to explore the determinants of turnout on party primaries by employing an original dataset comprising over 300 selection processes of candidates and leaders in Spain from 1991 to 2021 at both the national and regional level. One of our main findings suggests, in line with what has been affirmed by previous literature, a positive impact of competitiveness on turnout. We also find some contradictory effects of ideology on turnout: as expected most left-wing parties have better turnout averages than right-wing parties, but turnout is higher in primaries organised by right-wing parties. In addition, the type of primaries and the (online-offline) format of the event also appear to be a relevant factor shaping participation. © The Author(s) 2023.",competitiveness; intra-party participation; political parties; primaries; turnout,,,,,,"Universitat de València, 85|86; Spanish Government; Universidad de Murcia; Université Catholique de Lille; Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral, ESPOL, (UV-INV_AE -2631662 (2023)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: F Ram\u00F3n Villaplana acknowledges the Spanish Government and the University of Murcia for a Margarita Salas grant (2021), funded by NextGenerationEU.

Others argue that populism is a corrective to mainstream politics and not necessarily anti-democratic. While the relationship between populism and democracy is widely debated in theory and empirically assessed by estimating the effect of populist rule, we analyse discursive references to democracy in election manifestos and tweets of populist radical right (PRRP) and populist radical left (PRLP) parties in seven Western European countries. By mapping populists’ discourses on democracy across electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative and egalitarian dimensions, we find that PRLP elaborate a more coherent understanding of democracy (especially its participatory and egalitarian dimensions) and do not reject any dimension. PRRP hardly elaborate on any dimension except participation. PRRP appear as ‘void’ democrats with ambivalent and incoherent credentials, which at times reject and instrumentalise democracy. © The Author(s) 2023.",content analysis; democracy; political parties; populism; Western Europe,,,,,,,,"Albertazzi D., McDonnell D., Introducion, The Sceptre and the Spectre.
